Got it. Here’s a complete `Patch.md` you can paste over your current one. I added a persistent footer for a **PATCH CLIPBOARD** so AI can stage the next patchset at the bottom without hunting for a place to put it.

```md
# AI PROJECT MANAGER CONTRACT

This repository uses **Patch.md** as the single source of truth for automated, AI-driven development flow.
The AI reading this file must follow the loop and rules exactly.

## PRIME DIRECTIVE
Always read and parse `Tasklist.md` first. Work only on tasks whose `status: READY`.
After completing a task, update `Tasklist.md` *convulsively* (immediately) to reflect:
- `status: DONE` for the completed task (with a brief outcome note)
- Any newly-unblocked tasks moved to `status: READY`
- Any newly-discovered subtasks appended (with unique IDs) and appropriate status

## OPERATING LOOP
1. **Load Task Graph**
   - Read `Tasklist.md`.
   - Build an ordered plan from tasks where:
     - `status: READY`
     - All `depends_on` are `DONE`.
   - Never start tasks not marked `READY`.

2. **Execute**
   - For the first READY task in dependency order:
     - Apply code changes using **PATCH BLOCKS** format (below).
     - Keep changes minimal, reversible, and scoped to the task.
     - Run/adjust tests if present.

3. **Update Tasklist**
   - Mark the executed task `DONE`.
   - For any tasks now unblocked, change `status` to `READY`.
   - If you discover missing steps, create new tasks with unique `id` and clear `acceptance_criteria`.

4. **Commit**
   - Generate a commit message using the template below.
   - Multiple small commits are preferred over one giant diff.

5. **Repeat**
   - Return to step 1 until no `READY` tasks remain.

## PATCH BLOCKS (MANDATORY FORMAT)
Use the following structure for every change. Provide full-file content for creates/overwrites; use unified diffs for surgical edits when safer.

```

<<<PATCHSET START>>>

# [Task ID]: <short task title>

# FILE: <path/to/file.ext>

```full
<entire new file content here>
```

# FILE: <path/to/another.file>

```diff
@@
- old line
+ new line
```

# TASKLIST UPDATE

```diff
<unified diff patch against Tasklist.md that updates statuses, adds tasks, etc.>
```

<<<PATCHSET END>>>

```

Rules:
- Each PATCHSET handles exactly **one** Task ID.
- If a task requires multiple files, include multiple `# FILE:` sections in the same PATCHSET.
- Always include a `# TASKLIST UPDATE` diff at the end of the PATCHSET.

## COMMIT MESSAGE TEMPLATE
```

[Task <ID>] <Concise summary>

Why: <one or two sentences of the rationale>

Changes:

* <bullet of main change>
* <bullet of tests/docs if any>

Acceptance: <state how acceptance_criteria are met>

```

## SAFETY RAILS
- Do **not** edit secrets or CI/CD tokens.
- Stay within allowed paths unless a task explicitly expands scope.
- Prefer interaction-based Discord features (no message content intent required).
- Keep patches deterministic and idempotent (re-running yields same state).

## FILE PRIORITIES
- Code: `/src/**`
- Data pipeline: `/src/data_pipeline/**`
- Bot commands & DM UI: `/src/bot/**`
- Core mechanics: `/src/core/**`
- Tests: `/tests/**`
- Docs: root markdown files (`*.md`)

## READY DEFINITION
A task is `READY` if:
- It has clear `acceptance_criteria`
- All `depends_on` are `DONE`
- Scope is confined to allowed paths

If a task is ambiguous, create a small precursor task (`status: PROPOSED`) with a clarifying patch to reduce ambiguity, then mark it `READY`.

## DONE DEFINITION
A task is `DONE` if:
- The change compiles (if applicable) and basic lints pass
- Acceptance criteria are demonstrably met
- `Tasklist.md` records the outcome under that task

## FAILURE & ROLLBACK
If a PATCHSET introduces breakage:
- Emit a new PATCHSET to revert the specific files to their previous state.
- Mark the task `BLOCKED` with a short reason and create a `FIX:` task that is `READY`.

## WORKING GOAL
This project’s near-term goal is an **operable Pokémon Discord fan server bot** with:
- DM-as-Home (heal, party/box, starter flow, profile)
- Public `#wilds` channel encounter threads; controls from DM
- Public Arena threads for battles; players command in DM; spectators see summaries
- Persistent state in Postgres; reference data cached to repo by worker

## CRITICAL FILES & FAST-PATH LOOKUP
To minimize planning overhead, follow this fast-path order before the normal loop:
1. Read `ops/NEXT.yaml` to get the `next_task_id` and `files_hint`. Validate against `Tasklist.md`.
2. Open `Tasklist.md` to confirm status and dependencies. Only execute tasks that are `READY`.
3. Consult `ops/TOUCHMAP.yaml` for the primary files/paths for the task you are executing.
4. Skim `Prompt.md` for the environment overview and feedback loop; incorporate deltas if it informs the task.
5. Optionally consult `ops/KNOWLEDGE.yaml` for domain truth sources and paths.
6. Execute the normal OPERATING LOOP using PATCH BLOCKS.

On completion of any task:
- Update `ops/NEXT.yaml` to the next READY task and keep `files_hint` minimal but sufficient.
- Extend `ops/TOUCHMAP.yaml` if you touched relevant files not yet mapped.
- If the task changes system behavior or architecture, update `Prompt.md` (Revision History + impacted sections) and verify `ops/KNOWLEDGE.yaml` remains accurate.

Do not bloat these files. Keep them deterministic and concise.

---

## MODIFICATION POLICY: Patch.md & Tasklist.md

These files are the contract and the task graph. Update them deliberately and traceably.

When it’s OK to update `Patch.md`
- Contract evolution that improves automation (e.g., new PATCHSET rules, safety rails, or fast-path steps).
- Fixing ambiguous or conflicting instructions that block work.
- Adding/removing sections that improve clarity or determinism (e.g., new meta policies).
- Clipboard maintenance (the PATCH CLIPBOARD footer is the only place for live PATCHSET staging).

How to update `Patch.md`
1. Prefer doing it under a dedicated META task (id prefix `META:` or `T0.*`) with clear acceptance criteria.
2. Use a surgical diff in the PATCHSET; avoid rewriting the entire file unless necessary.
3. Include a `# TASKLIST UPDATE` that:
   - Marks the META task DONE.
   - Adds any follow-up tasks (e.g., updating `ops/CRITICAL.md`, `ops/NEXT.yaml`, or `ops/TOUCHMAP.yaml`).
4. Never store secrets; never remove the PATCH CLIPBOARD footer.

When it’s OK to update `Tasklist.md`
- Normal lifecycle transitions: READY → IN_PROGRESS → DONE, adding brief outcome notes.
- Unblocking newly-eligible tasks by flipping to READY.
- Adding discovered subtasks:
  - Use concise `id` (e.g., `T4.1a`) and clear `acceptance_criteria`.
  - Set initial `status: PROPOSED` or `READY` if immediately actionable.
- Marking tasks BLOCKED with a short reason and creating a `FIX:` task.

How to update `Tasklist.md`
1. Always via the `# TASKLIST UPDATE` unified diff within the current PATCHSET.
2. Keep the history lightweight: outcome notes belong on each task; deeper context goes to `Prompt.md` (Revision History) if architectural.
3. Avoid mass reformatting; preserve existing order and phases unless a META task explicitly reorganizes them.

Meta-Update Workflow (quick checklist)
1. Create/choose a META task (or the current task if its acceptance criteria require contract changes).
2. Edit `Patch.md`/`Tasklist.md` with minimal diffs; reflect any crossfile implications (`ops/NEXT.yaml`, `ops/CRITICAL.md`, `ops/TOUCHMAP.yaml`).
3. Update `Tasklist.md` (status changes, new tasks).
4. Commit with a message that states why the meta-change was necessary.

## PATCH CLIPBOARD (FOOTER)

This is a **staging area** where the AI can paste the next PATCHSET before applying it.  
It is intentionally placed at the bottom of `Patch.md` for quick access.  
This section may be overwritten frequently.

> **Rules for the Clipboard**
> - Only one PATCHSET may live here at a time.
> - After committing, either clear the clipboard or replace it with the next PATCHSET.
> - Do not store secrets here.

```

Yup — Render booted fine but died on `npm start` because there’s no start script. Easiest fix: add a `render.yaml` that tells Render exactly how to build and run your bot, so it doesn’t rely on `npm start`. Here’s a single PATCHSET that adds `render.yaml` and records the fix in your task graph.

**Commit Message**
```

[Task T0.FIX.RENDER_START] Add render.yaml with explicit build/start commands for Render

Why:
Render defaulted to `npm start` and failed because the repo lacks a start script. A render.yaml ensures TypeScript is built and the compiled JS is executed directly.

Changes:

* Added render.yaml with `buildCommand: npm ci && npm run build` and `startCommand: node dist/index.js`.
* Updated ops/NEXT.yaml files_hint to include render.yaml.
* Recorded fix in Tasklist as DONE.

Acceptance:
Deploy uses render.yaml, compiles to dist, and starts successfully without needing an npm start script.

```

If you’d rather keep everything inside `package.json`, I can ship an alternative PATCHSET that adds `"start": "node dist/index.js"` and (optionally) sets `"engines": { "node": ">=20" }`.
```
